# Hello and welcome :wink:

My name is Robert Rauh aka. _RedstoneFuture_ and here on GitHub I manage various projects, especially for the well-known game **Minecraft** from Mojang / Microsoft. I am a **Game-Designer and Server-Administrator**, both privately and professionally.

In addition to the main projects listed below, I naturally support some of the open-source plugin projects used by my servers.
